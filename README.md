# VibeMiner

A modern, seamless crypto mining experience for blockchain networks that need hashrate—**no terminal required**. Available as a **web app** and **desktop app** (Windows & macOS).

## Features

- **One-click mining** — Choose a network and start; no config files or CLI.
- **Network showcase** — Sections for each blockchain requesting the service (Monero, Raptoreum, Ergo, Kaspa, and more).
- **Easy integration** — Add new blockchains by editing `packages/shared/src/networks.ts` (or plug in your own API later).
- **Modern UI** — Dark theme, smooth animations (Framer Motion), and responsive layout.
- **Web + Desktop** — Use in the browser or install the Electron app on PC/Mac.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)

### Web app

```bash
# From repo root
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Auth: user and network accounts

Sign-in and registration use **Cloudflare D1** (database) and **KV** (sessions). Two account types:

- **Miner (user)** — Personal account to mine and track hashrate; access the miner dashboard.
- **Network** — For blockchains that want to request mining service; access the network dashboard and get listed.

**Setup:** See [`docs/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md`](docs/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md) for creating D1, KV, and R2. Auth requires these bindings; use `npm run preview` (from `apps/web`) to test auth locally. For **Vercel** deployment (monorepo), see [`docs/VERCEL.md`](docs/VERCEL.md).

### Desktop app (Electron)

```bash
npm install
npm run desktop
```

This starts the web app and opens it in an Electron window. For a production build:

```bash
cd apps/desktop && npm run build
```

The desktop app loads the deployed web URL in production (default: `https://vibeminer.tech`). Set `APP_URL` when building to use your custom domain.

**Releasing installers:** Push a version tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`) to trigger [`.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`](.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml). The workflow builds Windows, macOS, and Linux installers and creates a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/chiku524/crypto-miner/releases) with the artifacts. Then set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_WIN`, `_MAC`, and `_LINUX` in your web app env so the download page works. See **[`docs/TRUST_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md`](docs/TRUST_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md)** for the exact Vercel steps and trust/signing options; [`docs/DESKTOP_APP.md`](docs/DESKTOP_APP.md) for signing/notarization and marketplaces.

## Adding a blockchain network

Networks are split into **mainnet** (production, real rewards) and **devnet** (testing, no real value). Every entry is validated at load time so invalid data never reaches the UI.

1. Open `packages/shared/src/networks.ts`.
2. Add an object to **`MAINNET_NETWORKS_RAW`** or **`DEVNET_NETWORKS_RAW`** with:
   - **Required:** `id`, `name`, `symbol`, `description`, `icon`, `algorithm`, `environment` (`'mainnet'` or `'devnet'`), `status` (`'live'` | `'coming-soon'` | `'requested'`)
   - **Optional:** `poolUrl`, `poolPort`, `website`, `rewardRate`, `minPayout`, `requestedBy`
3. Ensure `id` is unique and matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$` (lowercase, hyphens OK).
4. Rebuild/restart. The new network appears in the correct section (Mainnet or Devnet) and, if `status === 'live'`, in the dashboard.

**Full contract:** See `packages/shared/INTEGRATION.md` for field rules, limits, and examples. Use `parseNetwork(raw)` or `registerNetwork(raw)` when adding networks programmatically (e.g. from an API).

## Mining in production

Networks include **pool URLs and ports** for real mining. The desktop app has a mining service for XMRig (Monero, Raptoreum). See [docs/MINING_INTEGRATION.md](./docs/MINING_INTEGRATION.md). The UI uses simulated hashrate; real mining is wired when XMRig is installed. To connect real mining:

1. **Pool integration** — Use each network’s pool API (e.g. Stratum, HTTP) to fetch live hashrate and balance.
2. **Miner binary** — For desktop, bundle or download a miner (e.g. xmrig for Monero) and orchestrate it from the Electron main process; the UI would show real stats from the miner or pool.
3. **Web** — Browser-based mining is limited; for real hashrate you’d typically use the desktop app with a local miner.

## Tech stack

- **Web**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers (OpenNext), D1, KV, R2
- **Desktop**: Electron
- **Shared**: `@vibeminer/shared` (network config + types)
