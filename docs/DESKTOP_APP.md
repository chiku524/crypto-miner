# VibeMiner desktop app — next steps, distribution & marketplaces

This doc covers next steps for the Electron desktop app, making it installable from the web landing page, and options for app store / marketplace distribution.

## 1. Creating a release (GitHub Actions)

Releases are built and published automatically when you **push a version tag** to the repo.

### Steps to publish a new desktop release

1. **Create and push a tag** (format `v*`, e.g. `v1.0.0`):
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Wait for the workflow** (`.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`):
   - Builds Windows (NSIS), macOS (dmg), and Linux (AppImage) on GitHub’s runners.
   - Sets the desktop app version from the tag (e.g. `v1.0.0` → `1.0.0`).
   - Creates a **GitHub Release** for that tag and attaches the three installers.

3. **Point the web app at the release**: In Vercel (or your host), set:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_WIN` = `https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/crypto-miner/releases/download/v1.0.0/VibeMiner%20Setup%201.0.0.exe`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_MAC` = `https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/crypto-miner/releases/download/v1.0.0/VibeMiner-1.0.0.dmg`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_LINUX` = `https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/crypto-miner/releases/download/v1.0.0/VibeMiner-1.0.0.AppImage`
   Replace `YOUR_ORG` and the version/tag with your repo and release (e.g. use `v1.0.0` for a fixed release, or update env when you cut a new release).

The `/download` page will then offer the correct installer per platform (and suggest the one for the user’s OS).

### Auto-updates

The desktop app uses **electron-updater** and checks GitHub Releases for new versions. When you push a new tag (e.g. `v1.0.2`), the release workflow builds installers and uploads them plus the update metadata (`latest.yml`, etc.) to the release. Installed apps check for updates on startup and every 4 hours; if a new version is available they download it in the background and install on the next quit. No extra setup is required beyond publishing releases as above.

## 2. Trust & security: code signing and notarization

Unsigned installers work but can trigger “unknown publisher” (Windows) or “unidentified developer” (macOS) warnings. For a **trustworthy install**, add signing and notarization and the required secrets.

### Windows (code signing)

To remove **“Unknown publisher”** and the SmartScreen warning, sign the Windows installer with a code signing certificate. The workflow is already set up: add two GitHub secrets and the next release will produce a signed `.exe`.

**Full step-by-step:** See **[`docs/WINDOWS_CODE_SIGNING.md`](WINDOWS_CODE_SIGNING.md)** for:

- Why the warning appears and what EV vs OV certificates do
- Where to buy a cert (DigiCert, Sectigo, SSL.com, etc.)
- How to export to `.pfx`, base64-encode it, and add **WIN_CODE_SIGNING_CERT_BASE64** and **WIN_CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD** as repo secrets

After the secrets are set, the release workflow decodes the cert and signs the Windows build automatically. `signAndEditExecutable` is already enabled in `apps/desktop/package.json`.

### macOS (notarization)

1. **Apple Developer account** and an **App-specific password** for notarization.
2. In the repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add:
   - `APPLE_ID`: your Apple ID email.
   - `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: app-specific password (create at appleid.apple.com).
   - `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: your Team ID (from developer.apple.com).
3. In `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`, uncomment the `APPLE_*` env vars in the **Build macOS installer** step.
4. Add **notarization** via electron-builder: install `@electron/notarize` and add an `afterSign` hook in `apps/desktop` that runs notarize (see [electron-builder macOS notarization](https://www.electron.build/code-signing#macos-notarization)). The desktop `package.json` already has `hardenedRuntime: true` and `gatekeeperAssess: false` so the app is ready for notarization.

After you add the secrets and uncomment the workflow env vars, the next release build will produce signed (Windows) and notarized (macOS) installers.

### Linux

AppImages are typically distributed without code signing. You can optionally GPG-sign the release assets and document the public key for verification.

## 3. Next steps for the desktop application (manual build)

### Build & host installers

1. **Build per platform** (from repo root or `apps/desktop`):
   ```bash
   cd apps/desktop && npm run build
   ```
   Outputs go to `apps/desktop/dist/`:
   - **Windows**: NSIS installer (e.g. `VibeMiner Setup 1.0.0.exe`)
   - **macOS**: `.dmg`
   - **Linux**: `.AppImage`

2. **Host the installers** so the web app can link to them. Options:
   - **GitHub Releases** (recommended for OSS): Create a release, upload the three artifacts, then set the download URLs in your web app env (see below).
   - **Cloudflare R2** (or S3): Upload build artifacts to a bucket and use public or signed URLs.
   - **Your own CDN / static host**: Serve the files and set the same env vars.

3. **Configure the landing page**: Set these in your web app environment (e.g. Cloudflare Pages env or `.env`):
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_WIN=https://github.com/your-org/crypto-miner/releases/download/v1.0.0/VibeMiner%20Setup%201.0.0.exe
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_MAC=https://github.com/your-org/crypto-miner/releases/download/v1.0.0/VibeMiner-1.0.0.dmg
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_LINUX=https://github.com/your-org/crypto-miner/releases/download/v1.0.0/VibeMiner-1.0.0.AppImage
   ```
   The `/download` page will then show the correct buttons; it also detects the user’s OS and highlights the matching download.

### Code signing (strongly recommended)

- **Windows**: Sign the `.exe` with a code signing certificate (e.g. from DigiCert, Sectigo). Without it, SmartScreen may warn users. Use `electron-builder`’s `signAndEditExecutable` and certificate config.
- **macOS**: Sign and notarize the app with an Apple Developer account so it opens without “unidentified developer” warnings. electron-builder supports `afterSign` hooks (e.g. notarize with `@electron/notarize`).

### Auto-updates

- Add **electron-updater** and point it at your release source (e.g. GitHub Releases or a custom server). Configure in the Electron main process and optionally expose an “Check for updates” action in the UI.

### Production mining (optional)

- The app currently loads the web dashboard. For real hashrate you can later bundle or download a miner binary (e.g. xmrig) and orchestrate it from the main process, with the UI showing live stats from the miner or pool API.

## 4. Installable via the landing page

Yes. This is already wired up:

- **`/download` page**: Lists Windows, macOS, and Linux. Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_*` to show download buttons; if none are set, it shows a “coming soon” style message and a link to the web dashboard.
- **Nav**: “Download” link in the header.
- **Hero**: “Download desktop” button next to “Start mining” and “View networks”.
- **Footer**: “Download” link.

Once you build the installers and set the three env vars, the landing page will offer the correct installer per platform (and suggest the one for the user’s OS).

## 5. Marketplaces and distribution

### Windows

| Option | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **Microsoft Store** | Requires a developer account (~$19 one-time). Package as MSIX or use the Desktop Bridge. Good for discoverability and trust. |
| **winget** | You can publish a package so users can run `winget install YourOrg.VibeMiner`. Requires a manifest and a publicly accessible installer URL (e.g. GitHub Releases). [winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) is the repo for community packages. |

### macOS

| Option | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **Mac App Store** | Requires Apple Developer Program ($99/year). Needs to follow App Store guidelines (sandboxing, etc.). |
| **Direct download** | Most Electron apps ship a signed/notarized `.dmg` from their website (or `/download`). No store fee; users download from your site. |

### Linux

| Option | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **Snap Store** | You can wrap the AppImage (or build a snap) and publish to the Snap Store. |
| **Flathub** | Publish a Flatpak; Flathub is the main store. Requires a manifest and build process. |
| **AppImage (direct)** | Your current build already produces an AppImage. Host it (e.g. GitHub Releases) and link from `/download`—no store required. |

### Summary

- **Fast path**: Use the **landing page `/download`** with installers hosted on **GitHub Releases** (or R2). Add **code signing** on Windows and **notarization** on macOS when you’re ready.
- **Stores**: Add **winget** for Windows (free, good for power users), and consider **Microsoft Store** and **Mac App Store** later for broader reach and trust.

## 6. Quick reference

- **Release from tag**: Push a tag `v*` (e.g. `v1.0.0`) → workflow builds and creates a GitHub Release with installers.
- **Desktop build (local)**: `cd apps/desktop && npm run build` → `dist/`
- **Web download page**: `/download`; env vars `NEXT_PUBLIC_DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_WIN`, `_MAC`, `_LINUX`
- **Docs**: Auth/setup → `docs/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md`; branding/SEO → `docs/SEO_AND_BRANDING.md`
